## About The App
As the name suggests it is basically a todo list using sticky notes. I wanted to use digital sticky notes wall using `react`. And also, input forms takes lots of space on wall which I didn't wanted. So, I have added spotlight to add new stickies. just hit
<kbd> ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> Enter </kbd> type `task,description.` in this format only. then done.
